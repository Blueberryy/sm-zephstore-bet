# sm-zephstore-bet
A plugin that allows players to bet credits. The more you bet, the more chances you have of winning.\
EDIT: It's called Jackpot, my bad

### How does it works?
At the start of every round, people can type !bet (amount) to bet an amount of credits (zephyrus store credits).\
The betting system is not really a 'betting system' -> the more you bet, the more chances you have of winning.\
Ex: Total bet is 100 and I have bet 10, I will have 10% win chance.

So, this can only be played with at least 2 players.
